# Stage 1: Ingest Architecture Baseline

This is the second public-facing narrative for Knowledge Pools.

Use this document after the ingest architecture has been clarified but before claiming a complete working MVP.

## Core Thesis

Ingest is not just file upload.

For an agent-oriented knowledge repository, ingest is the stage where source material becomes traceable, versioned, media-aware, and ready for later understanding.

## What Changed

The project now has a clearer ingest baseline:

- original sources stay in filesystem-compatible object storage;
- large files are accessed through manifests and access units;
- media types get different strategies;
- previews are stored as derived artifacts, not index content;
- OpenSearch-compatible documents stay content-minimal;
- deterministic IDs use source hashes and media hints;
- ingest and understand have an explicit boundary.

The important boundary is:

```text
ingest = preserve, normalize, segment, locate, classify, and propose
understand = interpret, extract knowledge units, align evidence, and prepare meaning for connection
```

## Why This Matters

Basic RAG often starts by chunking documents and putting embeddings into a database.

That can work for simple retrieval, but it weakens the system when it needs to answer:

- Where did this answer come from?
- Which exact source unit supports it?
- What changed when the source was updated?
- Is this summary evidence or just a preview?
- Did the system parse the source, or did it actually understand it?

The ingest stage needs to preserve those distinctions from the beginning.

## Design Moves

### 1. Source Store Is Ground Truth

Original text, PDFs, images, audio, JSON, and other files are stored as source objects.

The index points back to them. It does not replace them.

### 2. Access Units Make Large Sources Usable

Large or structured sources are broken into retrievable units:

- Markdown sections;
- PDF pages and blocks;
- image regions;
- audio time segments;
- transcript spans;
- JSON paths.

These units let later stages fetch exact evidence without loading an entire source into context.

### 3. Preview Artifacts Help Navigation

Preview data is useful, but it should not become the source of truth.

Examples:

- image thumbnails;
- standard-size image renditions;
- document summaries;
- page thumbnails;
- waveform previews.

The index stores preview refs and metadata, not preview bytes or long generated text.

### 4. Index Documents Are Retrieval Maps

OpenSearch is treated as a retrieval map.

It should store:

- source refs;
- access-unit locators;
- taxonomy metadata;
- preview refs;
- IDs and hashes;
- small labels and descriptors.

It should not store full source content as retrievable index content.

### 5. IDs Need a Policy

The recommended index ID shape is:

```text
kp:{repository_id}:{index_document_type}:{media_hint}:{source_hash_prefix}:{scope}
```

Example:

```text
kp:repo_main:access_unit:pdf:sha256_ab12cd34ef90:page_001_block_003
```

The media hint helps humans and routing, but the authoritative type is still `media_type`.

### 6. Ingest Must Not Pretend To Understand

Ingest may emit shallow candidates from visible structure.

It should not create durable knowledge records.

The next stage, `understand`, is where claims, decisions, concepts, procedures, and questions become explicit knowledge candidates.

## First Public Message

The second share should not claim the system is fully implemented.

It should say:

> I finished the first architecture boundary: ingest. The important lesson is that ingest is not just chunking. It is source preservation, access design, preview generation, ID policy, and a clear handoff to understanding.

## Suggested Korean Summary

```text
Knowledge Pools의 첫 번째 핵심 단계인 ingest 설계를 정리했습니다.

여기서 중요한 결론은 하나였습니다.

ingest는 단순히 파일을 업로드하고 chunk로 나누는 단계가 아닙니다.

장기적으로 신뢰할 수 있는 지식 시스템을 만들려면 ingest는 다음을 보장해야 합니다.

- 원본 source 보존
- source version과 content hash
- 큰 문서를 다시 찾아갈 수 있는 access unit
- 이미지, PDF, 오디오, Markdown별 media strategy
- thumbnail, summary, waveform 같은 preview artifact
- OpenSearch에는 원문이 아니라 locator와 metadata만 저장
- deterministic index ID
- understand 단계와의 명확한 경계

이번에 정리한 경계는 이렇게 잡았습니다.

ingest = preserve, normalize, segment, locate, classify, propose
understand = interpret, extract knowledge units, align evidence

즉 ingest는 "이해"하는 단계가 아니라,
나중에 정확히 이해할 수 있도록 source를 잃지 않고 준비하는 단계입니다.

RAG가 단순 chunk retrieval을 넘어가려면,
가장 먼저 source와 evidence를 다루는 입구부터 단단해야 한다고 봅니다.

Knowledge Pools의 ingest 단계 설계를 정리했습니다.

이번 단계에서 가장 중요했던 결론:

ingest는 단순 파일 업로드나 chunking이 아닙니다.

원본 source를 보존하고,
큰 문서를 access unit으로 나누고,
media별 preview artifact를 만들고,
OpenSearch에는 원문이 아니라 locator와 metadata만 저장하고,
다음 단계인 understand로 넘길 handoff를 명확히 하는 단계입니다.

경계는 이렇게 잡았습니다.

ingest = preserve, normalize, segment, locate, classify, propose
understand = interpret, extract knowledge units, align evidence

좋은 RAG/agent memory는 검색 이전에,
source와 evidence를 잃지 않는 ingest에서 시작된다고 봅니다.
```

## Suggested English Post

```text
I finished the ingest architecture baseline for Knowledge Pools.

The main lesson:

ingest is not just file upload or chunking.

For a durable agent-oriented knowledge repository, ingest has to preserve source evidence before the system tries to understand it.

The current boundary:

ingest = preserve, normalize, segment, locate, classify, propose
understand = interpret, extract knowledge units, align evidence

Ingest now covers:

- source object storage
- source versions and content hashes
- manifests and access units
- media-specific strategies for Markdown, images, WAV, and PDF
- preview artifacts like thumbnails, summaries, and waveform previews
- content-minimal OpenSearch projections
- deterministic index IDs
- explicit handoff to the understand stage

The index should help find the source.
It should not become the source.

This feels like the first important boundary: before building smarter agents, make sure the system never loses the evidence.
```

## Open Question

What should belong in ingest, and what should be delayed until understand?

This boundary seems small, but it determines whether the system can remain source-grounded as it grows.
